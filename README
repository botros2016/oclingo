gringo - A bottom up grounder for logic programs:
------------------------------------------------
gringo is distributed under the GNU Public Licence, see file COPYING for
details.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
------------------------------------------------
This software is under development. It supports a subset of the gringo
language plus some features that are not present in gringo. Additional
features include:
 - Relaxed restrictions on programs
 - #include directives
 - No domain predicates needed in (stratified) aggregates
 - Arbitrary literals in aggregates
 - Minimize statements with priorities
 - domain statements
 - show/hide statements with extended functionality
Not yet implemented:
 - Most aggregates: #count, #avg, #times, #even, #odd, #min, #max
 - Disjunction, conjunction
 - Compute statements (won't be implemented?)
 - #maximize (use negative weights for now)
 - classical negation
 - external statements (similar to maximize syntax)
 - further relexed safety: b :-  not not a(X)

Prerequisites:
--------------
 - Build system cmake:   http://www.cmake.org/
 - Lexer generator re2c: http://re2c.org/
 - Boost C++ Libraries:  http://www.boost.org/
