WARNING: This is a BETA version.

gringo 3.0.92 (beta version)
	* permit ==, <, <=, >, and >= to compare with bounds in aggregates
	* disjunctons and conjunctions (:) are back and better than before
gringo 3.0.91 (beta version)
	* experimental aggregates
	  * dlv-style
	  * recursive
	  * non-domain conditions
	* missing features
	  * ground input reader
	  * reified output
	  * #min, #max, #avg, #even, and, #odd aggregates
	  * disjunctions
	  * conjunctions using ":" in rule bodies
	* raise error if incremental program is not modular
	* improved/corrected grounding of base/cumulative/volatile parts
	  (volatile parts still contain glitches, best not define predicates there
	  or at least attach the incremental variable to them and use them only there)
	* numerous small bugfixes and new bugs
gringo 3.0.3
	* added (default) ODBC support in windows version
	* fixed bug in simplification of #count/#sum aggregates
	* fixed problem with incremental grounding
	* changed handling of strings and constants from within lua
	* added option to limit term depth while grounding incrementally
	* allow for tuples with only one element
gringo 3.0.2
	* improved literal ordering heuristic
	* fixed parsing problems with @ symbol
	* fixed wrong handling of minimize constraints
gringo 3.0.1
	* added possibility to intercept models using lua
	* fixed compilation issues with cmake-2.6
	* when appropriate automatic conversion from string to int in lua
	* support for unnamed function symbols (aka tuples)
	* fixed classical negation
gringo 3.0.0
	* relaxed restrictions on programs
	* no domain predicates needed in (stratified) aggregates
	* arbitrary literals in aggregates
	* lua scripting language to write custom functions
	* #include directives
	* #minimize statements with priorities
	* #show/#hide statements with extended functionality
	* #external statements (extends lparse counterpart)
