1 Prerequisites
---------------

To build the lexer used by gringo, the lexer-generator re2c is needed. 
Additionally, a recent version of the boost library is needed (> 1.35.*).
For development boost version 1.40 is used. This is the latest version
and may not be available as package on your system. But boost can easily
be installed locally (see boost documentation). Gringo depends on the 
two (non-header-only) boost libraries system and filesystem. Furthermore,
gringo uses the build system cmake. At least cmake version 1.6 is required.

2 Compilation:
--------------

To build gringo you have to create some folder and call cmake with the 
desired option from there. For *nix system there is a Makefile that wraps
cmake and allows for creating a debug, release or static build. On such 
systems the following command line should compile gringo:
	make BUILD_TYPE=<type>
where <type> is either debug, release or static.
Note that if you installed boost locally, you may have to specify the path
to the boost installation via the BOOST_ROOT variable.

3 Installation:
---------------

If compilation succeeded, the build folder will contain a bin folder with
a gringo executable, which should be copied somewhere into your path.
