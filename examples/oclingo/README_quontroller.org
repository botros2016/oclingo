* Overview
  Quontroller is a python script based on oclingo that allows interactive querying of ASP encodings. 

* Installation

  Install the oclingo source tree that includes the =quontroller.py= python scripts from

  :http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/wv/oclingo/quontroller.tar.bz2
  
  or

  : git clone https://github.com/grote/oclingo/tree/quontroller

  If you have already the latest oclingo version, it suffices if you only copy the folder example/oclingo from the 'quontroller' branch.

  =quontroller.py= is located at =examples/oclingo/= within the source tree. Accompanying example encodings can be found at =examples/oclingo/quontroller=.

** Dependencies
    
   =quontroller.py= depends on 
   - =controller.py=, which can be found at the same location as =quontroller.py= (i.e., in =example/oclingo/= relative to the root of the source tree);
   - python 2.7.x. with x >= 3;
   - latest oclingo development version from git (instruction for how to retrieve and build it are available at :http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/wv/oclingo/#get).


* Usage

The usage is demonstrated based on an edge-coloring encoding given in =examples/oclingo/quontroller/encoding.lp=. We assume that the current working directory is =example/oclingo/= relative to the root
of the oclingo source tree.

** Invocation of oclingo
   : oclingo quontroller/encoding.lp 

** Invocation of quontroller
   : ./quontroller.py -o quontroller/encoding.lp -c quontroller/setup.ini

   The quontroller takes the problem encoding and the setup information as input. Afterwards it forks an oclingo process and tries to connect to it. The connection has been established, when the following prompt appears:
   : [Quontroller-Mode] Please enter your query.
   Now queries can be entered on the command line. For instance, as follows:
   #+begin_src R    
   #query.
   #assert : e(1).
   edge(1,2).
   edge(1,3).
   edge(2,3).
   edge(2,4).
   edge(3,4).
   #endquery.


   #query.
   #assert.
   mark(1,1).
   #endquery.

 
   #query.
   #assert : e(2).
   edge(1,4).
   #endquery.
 
   #query.
   #retract : e(2).
   #assert.
   mark(1,1).
   mark(2,2).
   #endquery.

 
   #query.
   #retract : e(1).
   #endquery.

   #stop.

   #+end_src
